**The program searches for every sixth word of the text entered by the user. In this case, the seventh word from the collected buffer is written in the reverse order of letters. The program is implemented on TASM**

Here you will find two versions of the code. The code labeled 2 is a second version of the program. In my opinion, this version is more logical and modular. This means that you could take my procedure and incorporate it into your code. There are some elements that are repeated in both versions, but I'm not sure if that's a problem. ðŸ˜Š
